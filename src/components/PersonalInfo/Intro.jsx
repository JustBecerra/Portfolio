            I'm a Junior Full Stack Web Developer looking for opportunities to enhance my knowledge.
            I graduated from SoyHenry's Bootcamp after 800+ hours of programming.
            Hardworking, team player, precise and stoic.<br/>
            Fully capable and willing to work with others to achieve new goals.
            When I come face to face with a problem, I try to fix it myself but I'm not shy about asking others for help.<br/>
            My goals for the future are to join a great group of developers, learn alongside them and work remotely while travelling if possible.
